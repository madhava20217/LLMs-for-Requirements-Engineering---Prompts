# README

This repository contains the prompts, contexts, settings and generated documents for our work "Using LLMs in Software Requirements Engineering: An Empirical Evaluation" accepted to RE@Next! at the International Requirements Engineering Conference 2024 (RE'24) to facilitate reproducibility.

There are three parts to this repository:
1. SRS generation - prompts
2. SRS generation - final SRS documents
3. SRS validation and correction
